# ProtestFind

In the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed, gasping for air under the knee of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, the United States of America faces the incarnation of a civil rights movement, hundreds of years in the making. George Floyd’s death isn’t the first of its kind. Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and many more are part of those affected by racism and police brutality.

Black Americans are a staggering 2.5 times more likely to be killed by law enforcement than white Americans. They also make up 26.4% of those killed by police while only making up 12% of the US population. People who are black are faced with racism all throughout their lives, and now, in the midst of a huge social movement, it’s time for some true change. Protests are becoming extremely necessary so that we are able to exact change in state/governmental policy. As protests begin to come up all throughout the country, it is necessary that people are able to set up these protests in a civil and organized way. This is the purpose of ProtestFind.

ProtestFind is an online service that allows people to create and join peaceful protests throughout the country. Once your account is created by providing an email, username, and password, you are able to create and join protests. You may create a new protest by providing a location or join a protest by finding a location near you, and clicking the join button. The number of people participating in a certain protest will be shown to the side of each available protest. We are currently in one of the darker times in our country’s history. By using ProtestFind and effectively organizing peaceful protests, we will be one big step closer to causing real change. And we are long due for some change.
